# üöÄ GitOps & Cloud Utilisation ‚Äî 3-Month Roadmap (README)

This repository tracks a focused 12-week journey to master **GitOps**, **Cloud Utilisation**, **FinOps**, **Reliability**, and **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. Designed for a senior engineer, it emphasizes production-grade practices and measurable outcomes.

---

## üéØ Learning Goals

- Operate Kubernetes with **GitOps** as the single source of truth.
- Master **IaC** (Terraform or Pulumi) for end-to-end, reproducible infrastructure.
- Apply **FinOps** to control and optimize cloud spend.
- Build **Reliability** guardrails: observability, autoscaling, progressive delivery, chaos testing, SLOs, DR.
- Produce a **portfolio-ready capstone** that demonstrates all of the above.

---

## üß≠ How to Use This Repo

- Track progress by ticking checkboxes `[ ] ‚Üí [x]`.
- Each month has **Detailed Outcomes** with **Evidence Artifacts** you must produce.
- Each week has **tasks, deliverables, and resource links**.
- Keep docs in `/docs`, IaC in `/iac`, app manifests in `/manifests`, dashboards/policies under `/ops`.

## üìÖ Roadmap Overview

- **Month 1:** GitOps & Cloud-Native Foundations
- **Month 2:** IaC, Observability & Reliability
- **Month 3:** FinOps, Security & Advanced Reliability

---

## ‚úÖ Month 1 ‚Äî GitOps & Cloud-Native Foundations

**Goal:** Boot a managed K8s cluster, wire **GitOps** from day one, and begin IaC.

### Learning Activities

- Install and configure **Argo CD** (or Flux CD).
- Deploy a demo app; drive changes via **PRs**; test rollback from Git.
- Create **multi-environment** structure (dev/stage/prod) with app + config separation.
- Provision a **managed K8s** cluster (EKS/GKE/AKS).
- Begin **Terraform**: VPC/network + cluster provisioning.

### Detailed Outcomes (Measurable)

- [ ] **Git-driven deployments**: Any manifest change merged to `main` reconciles automatically within ‚â§5 minutes; rollback performed by reverting a commit.
- [ ] **Multi-env strategy**: Clear separation of envs (folders or branches) + per-env overlays (Kustomize or Helm) with sealed/external secrets.
- [ ] **Managed cluster online**: Public endpoint reachable; baseline namespaces `{platform, dev, stage, prod}` created by GitOps.
- [ ] **Terraform baseline**: Idempotent `apply` creates VPC + K8s + node groups; `destroy` fully tears down (no orphans).

### Evidence Artifacts (to commit under `docs/` & `manifests/`)

- Architecture note: **gitops-topology.md** (repos, app of apps, env structure).
- **runbook-deploy-rollback.md** with exact commands/screens.
- **terraform-baseline.md** with state backend, workspaces, and module layout.

---

## ‚úÖ Month 2 ‚Äî IaC, Observability & Reliability

**Goal:** Expand IaC to full infra; add observability; implement autoscaling and progressive delivery; validate resilience.

### Learning Activities

- Extend **Terraform** modules (VPC, DB/cache, cluster, monitoring, budgets).
- Integrate **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (or Terraform Cloud) for IaC pipelines; Argo CD for app delivery.
- Install **Prometheus + Grafana** (metrics) and **Loki/EFK** (logs).
- Configure **HPA** and **Cluster Autoscaler**.
- Use **Argo Rollouts** for **canary/blue-green** strategies.
- Run **chaos experiments** (LitmusChaos/Gremlin): pod kill, network latency.

### Detailed Outcomes (Measurable)

- [ ] **IaC owns infra**: No manual clicks; changes only via PRs. A fresh account/ project can be bootstrapped end-to-end in ‚â§60 minutes.
- [ ] **Observability SLIs**: Grafana shows **latency (p50/p95)**, **error rate**, **saturation**; logs are searchable by app, env, and trace ID.
- [ ] **Autoscaling**: HPA responds to CPU/RAM or custom metrics; cluster scales nodes under load; capacity graphs recorded.
- [ ] **Progressive delivery**: Canary deploy routes ‚â§10/30/100% with auto/Manual promotion; rollback under 2 minutes.
- [ ] **Resilience**: At least **3 chaos experiments** executed with documented hypotheses and outcomes.

### Evidence Artifacts

- **observability-dashboards.md** with screenshots + panel JSON exports (commit to `/ops/dashboards`).
- **rollouts-canary-plan.md** with traffic steps, abort criteria, rollback steps.
- **chaos-experiments.md** (hypothesis ‚Üí method ‚Üí expected vs. actual ‚Üí follow-ups).

---

## ‚úÖ Month 3 ‚Äî FinOps, Security & Advanced Reliability

**Goal:** Optimize cost, enforce guardrails, define SLOs, and prove full DR from Git.

### Learning Activities

- **FinOps**: Install **Kubecost**, set **budgets** and **anomaly alerts**; rightsizing; spot/preemptible strategies.
- **Security/Policy**: **OPA Gatekeeper** or **Kyverno** (mandatory limits, disallow privileged, enforce namespaces/labels); IAM/RBAC mapping.
- **Reliability**: Define **SLIs/SLOs/SLAs**; DR: restore entire stack from Git + IaC; incident playbooks.

### Detailed Outcomes (Measurable)

- [ ] **Cost visibility**: Kubecost shows per-namespace/team spend; weekly cost report auto-generated; budget alerts fire on breach.
- [ ] **Rightsizing**: Requests/limits tuned to <20% headroom on average with controlled p95 throttling; spot usage quantified.
- [ ] **Policy as code**: At least **5 enforced policies**; PRs failing when violations occur; exemption workflow documented.
- [ ] **SLOs live**: SLI queries defined; Grafana SLO dashboard with burn-rate alerts (e.g., 1h and 6h windows).
- [ ] **DR proof**: New environment bootstrapped **100% from Git** (IaC + GitOps) in ‚â§90 minutes; recovery steps documented and rehearsed.

### Evidence Artifacts

- **finops-report-YYYY-MM.md** with snapshots and key findings.
- **policy-catalog.md** with links to rego/kyverno rules and rationale.
- **slos-and-burn-rates.md** including alert rules.
- **dr-playbook.md** with stopwatch timings and pitfalls.
